# Arduino-Code
A collection of coded projects from high school and the C-STEM course

## trafficLight.ch
- Lights up a red LED, then changes to green and yellow with delays after a button is pressed

## thermoresistor.ch
- Turns on LEDs based on temperature

## photoLinkbotLED.ch
- The speed and the color of the Linkbot's LED is determined by the level of light detected by the photoresistor

## speedBotSpin.ch
- The speed of the Linkbot spinning is controlled by a potentiometer

## 1-7.ino
- Lights up LEDs based on the reading of a SPDT switch, photoresistor, and button
