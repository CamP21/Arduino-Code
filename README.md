- Lights up a red LED, then changes to green and yellow with delays after a button is pressed
 - When the button is not pressed, only the red LED is on
 - When the button is pressed, the red LED is turned off, the green LED is turned on for 3 seconds before turning off, and the yellow LED is turned on for 1 second before turning off, and finally it returns to just only the red LED on until the button is pressed once more.
